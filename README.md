# Hi, I'm Ellie

I'm a recent graduate of Bristol's DevelopMe_ full stack developer bootcamp, budding front-ender, ex-agency copywriter, and perpetual creative. :art: 

## About

While I've trained as a full stack developer, my first love is front end. I particularly enjoy combining my art skills with coding by recreating my designs as fully-functioning web pages.

In a previous life, I worked as a staff writer/Wordpress tinkerer and copywriter at two busy creative agencies. I've also been a civil servant and teacher in Japan, an editorial assistant for an academic journal, and a bookseller with strong opinions about fantasy fiction.

## What's DevelopMe_?

It's an intensive [full stack bootcamp](https://developme.tech/) based in Bristol and taught by industry professionals, updating in real-time to reflect the latest changes in real life web development. Essentially, I learned software development using the web stack, going from near-complete coding novice to full stack developer over the course of three months.
